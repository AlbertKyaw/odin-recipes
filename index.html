    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 pounds chicken wings</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger root</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons green onions</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Mix baking powder, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Pat chicken wings dry with paper towels, then toss them in spice mixture until evenly coated. Arrange wings in a single layer in the air fryer basket.</li>
        <li>Cook wings in the preheated air fryer until crispy and golden brown, juices are clear, and meat is no longer pink at the bone, 20 to 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the honey garlic sauce. Stir honey, soy sauce, garlic, and ginger together in a small saucepan over medium heat.</li>
        <li>In a separate small bowl, whisk together cornstarch and water until smooth, then add to the saucepan. Cook until sauce thickens, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer wings to a large bowl, pour honey garlic sauce over wings, and toss to coat evenly. Garnish with chopped green onions and serve hot.</li>

    </h2>
    <p>
        If you're a firm believer that potatoes make basically any meal taste better, then you've come to the right place. Because we are too — especially when it comes to breakfast potatoes.
        Choosing which type of breakfast potato to make can be a tough decision, but if you're craving crispy potatoes that remind you of your favorite restaurant, then you should try this hash brown recipe.
        The shredded potatoes are formed into pancake-like hash browns and lightly pan-fried for the perfect crispy texture that will pair deliciously with any breakfast dish.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 medium russet potatoes, shredded</li>
        <li>½ medium onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Rinse shredded potatoes until water is clear, then drain and squeeze dry.</li>
        <li>Place shreds in a bowl and mix in the onion, flour, and egg until evenly distributed.</li>
        <li>Heat about 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When oil is sizzling hot, place potatoes into the pan in a 1/2 inch thick layer. Cover the whole bottom of the pan, or make separate piles like pancakes.</li>
        <li>Cook until nicely browned on the bottom, then flip over and brown on the other side. It should take at least 5 minutes per side. If you are cooking them in one big piece, it can be cut into quarters for easier flipping.</li>
        <li>Remove from pan, and drain on paper towels. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

    <p>
        Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes but I think this worked beautifully.
        We are talking about bacon, cheese, and onions after all, so it wasn't that big of a shock.
        The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought everything together was a risk well rewarded.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Ingredients
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced green onions</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>¾ cup cornmeal</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 ⅓ cups milk</li>
        <li>2 ounces sharp Cheddar cheese, grated</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup warm maple syrup, or to taste</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon chipotle chile powder, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes; remove from heat. Stir green onions into bacon and saute in hot fat until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer bacon mixture to a strainer to drain, retaining drippings.</li>
        <li>Whisk flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a large bowl. Add drained bacon mixture, milk, Cheddar cheese, eggs, melted butter, and sugar to flour mixture; whisk until batter is smooth. Let batter rest for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Combine maple syrup and chipotle chile powder together in a small bowl; whisk until chile powder is completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 teaspoon bacon drippings, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1 teaspoon butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Drop batter by 1/4-cupful onto the griddle and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side, 2 to 3 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. Transfer pancakes to plate and top with maple syrup.</li>
    </ol>
